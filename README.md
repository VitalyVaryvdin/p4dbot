# Perforce Commit Logger Discord Bot 

With this bot you're able to keep track of commits made to a [Perforce version control](https://www.perforce.com/) server within a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) channel. 

## Installation Steps 

### Setup Python

Install `python2.7`  
Install `python-pip`  
Install `pip install enum34`  
Install `pip install Discord-Webhooks`  

### Setup P4

We have to install P4 on your computer.

**Linux:**

If the perforce server is using SSL, you'll have to trust the certificate. To know if it is using ssl, the perforce url should start with `ssl:<URL>`

```
p4 -p <PERFORCE URL> trust
```

### Setup bot

1. Within your Discord server go to the settings for the channel you'd like the commit logs to be posted to and copy the webhook URL.
2. In order to use this bot the config file needs to be set up `config.json`
3. The service requires access to the `p4 changes` command in the terminal, your bot should be installed somewhere where it can automatically perform this command without the session expiring. `$ python commit.py` to initialize it.
4. Optionally you should consider creating a CRON script or something similar that restarts the `commit.py` file on server reboot in order to keep the bot alive.

## Getting Started

Every `n` seconds the bot runs a Perforce command in the terminal that checks for the most recent changes. If it finds one it stores it in memory, if the change it finds is the same as the one it gathered previously then it discards it.

You'll need to provide the bot with access to your servers Perforce command line. One way of doing this is running the Python application on the server which hosts your Perforce instance alternatively you can store the perforce credentials in the `config.js` . 

If you can type `p4 changes` yourself then the bot will be able to do its thing.
